        <p> ~~~~So today is Friday July 26, 2019 9:48pm and honestly I'm waiting for the new Little Mermaid to come out because I want to see Harry as Prince Eric.üòÇ I also recently read something that Louis was looking at tour dates in 2020 and I'm starting to think that One Direction isn't going tocome back next year. I feel like even if they did, it would be really different. They are all very successful in their solo carreers and even if they do manage to get back together it would probably be like Migos or Bts because while they are groups they also have their successful solo carreers on the side. Also while on Instagram I found a post and am honestly happy because a fan asked about the well being of Cliff (Louis' dog) on twitter and Louis answered that he was just "Chilling in the shade". Thats honestly so cute!üòç *Picture down below* I'm so tired, I've been coding and editing all day and still need to finish, I took a break to write this, lol. Byeeeee üíï </p>

        <p> ~~~~Wednesday July 31, 2019 9:05am... So Louis posted pictures of him in the studio and I CAN"T WAIT for his new music. Also my mom told me that I "abandonded" One Ditrection when Zayn left but I don't really agree with that. After Zayn left I was just mad/sad so I stopped really paying attention to them and literally only listened to their previous albums. Because I stopped really paying attention to them, I didn't really know about them going on hiatus until this one random girl was like "Oh no one likes One Direction. That's why they are on hiatus" and I was like wow. But yeah so then I made my instagram account and now here we are now. Do you think that I "abandonded" them or not? Did you do the same? Let me know in my Sarahah. </p>
